## Deal or No Deal Expected Value Calculator

A website that calculates the expected value, along with other statistics, for a given board
state of the TV game show Deal or No Deal.

# Features

* Calculates the expected value of the board given the cases remaining on it and uses the number of cases that the
  player needs to open next round to calculate volatility of the board
* Users can load in special boards(Million Dollar Madness, Double Deal) used on the show


# Future Plans

* Support the special boards used, usually for holidays, that have non-numerical prizes on them.
* Compute analytics for the show (average amount won, which contestant took the best and worst offer etc.)
    * From what I can tell, this would require watching every episode of the show and taking notes unless there is a DB
      of this stuff already that I didn't find
* Allow users to select a contestant's specific board state
* Create a simulation of the game and allow users to play
